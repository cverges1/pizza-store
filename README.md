## Description

The Pizza Store is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) application tailored for pizza store owners to efficiently manage their pizza offerings and toppings. Through a RESTful API, owners can seamlessly perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on both toppings and pizzas.

Features:
- Pizza Management: Easily add, edit, and remove pizzas from the menu.
- Topping Management: Manage a comprehensive list of pizza toppings with ease.
- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive UI designed for seamless navigation and operation.
- MERN Stack Architecture: Utilizes MongoDB for database management, Express.js for the server, React.js for the frontend, and Node.js for backend development.

Additional Back-End/API Development

While Node.js was chosen for its familiarity and ease of implementation, I'm eager to expand my skills by exploring Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Despite being new territory for me, I'm excited to take on the challenge and plan to develop a secondary back-end/ Api using Ruby/Ruby on Rails.
